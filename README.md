# Encryption Program

This is a simple encryption and decryption program implemented in C++ that demonstrates how to apply a basic encryption algorithm. The program uses a key-based system to encrypt and decrypt user-inputted strings.

## Features

- **Encryption:** The program encrypts the user's input string by adding a key value to each character's ASCII code.
- **Decryption:** The program decrypts the encrypted string by subtracting the key value from each character's ASCII code.
- **Key Algorithm:** A simple algorithm using a constant key value generated by a mathematical expression (`pow(2, 2 * 5 / 4)`).

## How it works

1. **User Input:**
   - The program prompts the user to input a string or password that they want to encrypt.

2. **Encryption:**
   - The `Encryptionvar` function takes the input string and the encryption key (calculated as `pow(2, 2 * 5 / 4)`).
   - Each character of the string is modified by adding the key value to its ASCII code.

3. **Decryption:**
   - The `Decryption` function takes the encrypted string and subtracts the same key value from each character's ASCII code to retrieve the original string.

4. **Key Calculation:**
   - The key is calculated using the expression `pow(2, 2 * 5 / 4)`, which results in the key value `16`.
